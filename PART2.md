## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Changed setting gameboard still stuck. We try to use many method but still can't link the rows and column inside a function to our gameboard. And we try to save them to a text file, but it just can read as a text not a variable, so no solution for this. Next is default game board we found that use rand(), after we run how many times it still remain same place so we use srand(). We are having many problem when typing all this code, and we try to solve by ourselve, search from google, but still can't solve it. Therefore we are sorry for the incomplete assignment.
